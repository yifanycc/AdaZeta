# Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even
# though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils
#  from their bodies. Fist the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this
#   ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.
# Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual	Output:0

# Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.
# Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on	Output:1
#
# Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?
# Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected	Output:2

# Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?
# Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits	Output:0
